# Bike Trip Analysis
## Overview of Project

The purpose of the analysis is to present an analysis on how solid business is the bike-sharing program in the city of Des Moines . 

## Results

The images below represent the __Checkout Times for All Users__ and __Checkout Times by Gender__ respectively. The first one shows that *__most of the trip duration takes place in the first our__*, having its *__peak in the 10th minute__*. The second shows, that same pattern when looking at trip duration by gender which allows to conclude that *__males ride three times more than females__*.

Looking at the graph __Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)__ we can see that for *__weekdays__* both female and male tend to ride the most early in the morning (*__in the hours between 6 AM and 9 AM__*) and in the afternoon *__in the hours between 5 PM and 7 PM__*. For both gender *__weekend rides__* take place mostly *__between 8 AM and 7 PM__*. These pattern are evidenced by the graph __Trips by Weekday for Each Hour__.

The results mentioned in the last paragraph can be observed in the graphs below, respectively.

When looking at the graph __User Trips by Gender by Weekday__ we can observe that *__subscribers ride 10 times more then eventual customers__*. It is also noticeable that Thursdays has the higher number of rides when Saturdays has the least.

Another interesting data is shown in the graph __Average Trip Duration by Age__ where it is seen that a *__higher volume in bike usage by the ones born in the 90's__*. It also shows a tendency that *__the younger users are, the more they ride__*.

## Summary
When we look at the above results of the graphs, that can also be  visualized in the Tableau story in the link below, we understand that bike sharing business has mainly youth males as users which is shown to have a higher volume of trips. However, this volume is mostly sustained by subscribers rather than eventual users.

It is also noticeable that the business is viable in each day of a week having commuting appearing to be the purpose of the weekdays trips and leisure the purpose of the weekends rides.

The incidence of bike maintenance is mitigated by the high number of bicycles that allows an even usage of the bikes with a high volume of user and trips.

To have a better understande of the geografic distribution of the trips a map of volume of trips by start point locations is suggested as much as a map with the volume of trips by stop locations. Theses could give an understanding of where would be do areas in the city that could have more offers of bicycles and propaganda.
